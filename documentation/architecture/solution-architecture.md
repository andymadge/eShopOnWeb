## Business Process Flows

### Customer Purchase Journey

```
1. Discovery
   └→ Browse catalog → Filter by brand/type → View product details

2. Consideration
   └→ Add to basket → Adjust quantities → Continue shopping

3. Purchase
   └→ Checkout → Provide shipping address → Confirm order

4. Post-Purchase
   └→ View order history → Check order details
```

**Business Rules Enforced**:
- Can't checkout with empty basket (validation)
- Prices locked at order time (snapshot pattern)
- Basket persists between sessions (user retention)
- Anonymous basket merges on login (conversion optimization)

### Admin Catalog Management

```
1. Login
   └→ Admin credentials → JWT token issued

2. Browse Catalog
   └→ View all items → Filter/search

3. Modify Item
   └→ Edit details → Upload image → Save

4. Create New Item
   └→ Choose brand/type → Set price → Upload image → Publish
```

**Business Rules Enforced**:
- Authentication required (security)
- Price must be positive (data integrity)
- Name and description required (quality control)
- Brand and type must exist (referential integrity)

## Decision Criteria & Trade-offs

### Architecture Decision: Clean Architecture (Layered)

**Decision**: Separate domain logic from infrastructure

**Business Benefits**:
- **Flexibility**: Can change database or UI without touching business logic
- **Testability**: Reduces bugs, increases confidence
- **Maintainability**: Easier for new developers to understand

**Trade-offs**:
- More projects/folders (steeper learning curve initially)
- More abstractions (additional code)

**Rationale**: Long-term maintainability and quality outweigh initial complexity

### Architecture Decision: Multiple UI Technologies

**Decision**: Support MVC, Razor Pages, Blazor Server, and Blazor WebAssembly

**Business Benefits**:
- **Flexibility**: Choose best tool for each use case
- **Demonstration**: Shows .NET versatility
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new channels (mobile, desktop)

**Trade-offs**:
- More dependencies
- Requires team knowledge of multiple tech

**Rationale**: Demonstrates platform capabilities, prepares for multi-channel future

### Architecture Decision: Separate Catalog and Identity Databases

**Decision**: Two SQL Server databases instead of one

**Business Benefits**:
- **Security**: Identity data isolated (compliance)
- **Scalability**: Can scale independently
- **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can manage different databases

**Trade-offs**:
- No cross-database transactions
- Slightly more complex deployment

**Rationale**: Security and scalability requirements justify complexity

### Architecture Decision: API-First Design

**Decision**: Build RESTful API as first-class citizen

**Business Benefits**:
- **Integration**: Third parties can integrate easily
- **Mobile-Ready**: Mobile apps can consume API
- **Automation**: Enables automated workflows

**Trade-offs**:
- Additional project (PublicApi)
- Separate authentication (JWT)

**Rationale**: Enables future business opportunities (partnerships, mobile app)

## Business Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Complexity Overwhelming Small Teams

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive documentation
- Clear patterns throughout
- Can start simple, grow complexity as needed

### Risk: Performance at Scale

**Mitigation**:
- Caching strategy in place
- Stateless design enables horizontal scaling
- Azure SQL can scale vertically

### Risk: Security Vulnerabilities

**Mitigation**:
- Modern authentication (ASP.NET Core Identity, JWT)
- Input validation (Guard clauses, FluentValidation)
- HTTPS enforced
- Regular dependency updates

### Risk: Cloud Costs

**Mitigation**:
- Start with lower tiers (S1 App Service, S1 SQL)
- Auto-scaling (pay for what you use)
- Can run on-premises if needed (Docker)
